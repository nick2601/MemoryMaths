## Opening (0:00 - 1:30) - Setting the Stage

**"Good morning, panel members. Thank you for this opportunity to present my research work that I believe demonstrates the technical excellence and innovative thinking you're seeking for the Research Software Engineer position.**

**Today, I'll walk you through Memory Maths - an accessible educational technology project that perfectly embodies the intersection of software engineering excellence and health informatics that defines your team's mission.**

**[Show Slide 1 - Title]**

**In the next 15 minutes, I'll demonstrate how this project showcases exactly what you need: 70% software delivery capabilities, 20% research and management skills, and 10% specialized technical expertise - all focused on making health data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.**

**Let me start with the challenge that drove this innovation...**

## Problem Statement & Vision (1:30 - 3:00) - Why This Matters

**[Show Slide 2 - Executive Summary]**

**The problem is stark: traditional educational technology fails users with dyslexia and early-onset dementia. These populations need specialized cognitive training tools, but most applications ignore accessibility principles and adaptive learning.**

**Memory Maths addresses this gap through:**
- **18 sophisticated game types** that provide comprehensive cognitive assessment
- **Accessibility-first design** using OpenDyslexic fonts and high-contrast themes
- **AI-powered adaptive difficulty** that personalizes learning in real-time
- **Clinical-grade analytics** with exportable progress reports

**But here's the key insight: this isn't just an educational app. It's a **digital therapeutic platform** ready for clinical integration. Every design decision was made with health informatics principles in mind.**

**The technology stack demonstrates full-stack capabilities:**
- **Flutter/Dart** for cross-platform deployment
- **Provider pattern** with sophisticated state management
- **Repository architecture** for scalable data handling
- **Comprehensive testing** with 300+ unit tests and 85% coverage

## Technical Architecture Deep Dive (3:00 - 6:00) - Software Engineering Excellence

**[Show Slide 3 - Technical Architecture]**

**Let me walk you through the architecture that makes this scalable and maintainable...**

**First, the **design patterns** - I've implemented six core patterns:**
1. **Provider Pattern with ChangeNotifier** - Reactive state management
2. **Service Locator using GetIt** - Clean dependency injection
3. **Repository Pattern** - Data abstraction for each game type
4. **Observer Pattern** - Efficient UI updates
5. **Factory Pattern** - Dynamic content generation
6. **Singleton Pattern** - Global service management

**[Show code example from your GameProvider]**
```dart
class GameProvider<T> with ChangeNotifier, WidgetsBindingObserver {
  final AdaptiveDifficultyManager _adaptive;
  final TimeProvider _timeProvider;
  
  void recordAnswer(bool isCorrect, Duration responseTime) {
    _adaptive.recordSample(
      isCorrect: isCorrect, 
      responseMillis: responseTime.inMilliseconds
    );
    _updateDifficulty();
    notifyListeners();
  }
}
```

**This architecture directly addresses your requirements:**
- **Python/OOP expertise** - Advanced object-oriented patterns in Dart
- **Database technologies** - Structured data persistence and retrieval
- **Version control** - Git-based workflow with comprehensive commit history
- **Agile practices** - Iterative development with continuous testing

**The **scalability proof** is in the numbers: 18 independent game modules, each completely isolated, demonstrating that this architecture can easily support 50+ game types without modification.**

## Health Informatics Integration (6:00 - 8:30) - Research Impact

**[Show Slide 4 - Health Informatics & Data Standards]**

**Now, let's talk about how this aligns with your health informatics mission - making NHS data FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable...**

**Every aspect of Memory Maths embodies these principles:**

**FINDABLE:** 
- Structured cognitive assessment data with standardized metrics
- Searchable performance patterns across game types
- Categorized skill assessments for easy retrieval

**ACCESSIBLE:**
- Multi-format export capabilities (PDF, JSON, CSV)
- RESTful API architecture ready for clinical systems integration
- Cross-platform deployment (Android, iOS, Web)

**INTEROPERABLE:**
- Standard health data structures prepared for FHIR compliance
- Modular architecture supporting multiple data formats
- Clinical terminology alignment for seamless NHS integration

**REUSABLE:**
- Repository pattern enables data reuse across different contexts
- Modular game architecture supports clinical trial integration
- Adaptive algorithms ready for federated learning scenarios

**[Show Slide 5 - Innovative Solutions]**

**The **Adaptive Difficulty Engine** represents genuine innovation:**
```dart
class AdaptiveDifficultyManager {
  void recordSample({required bool isCorrect, required int responseMillis});
  DifficultyAdjustment suggestAdjustment();
  PerformanceMetrics analyzePattern();
}
```

**This system:**
- **Monitors accuracy and response times** in real-time
- **Identifies learning patterns** through rolling performance windows
- **Maintains optimal challenge levels** (60-80% accuracy targets)
